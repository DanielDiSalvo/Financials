# Financials App

**Welcome to Financials App!**

## My name is Daniel Di Salvo. Software developer with over 5 years of demonstrated experience with web development, working mainly with JavaScript and React Js in agile teams.

## This is a fullstack application. 

We have a BE service which sends two differents tables: Accounts and Business. 

Also we have a FE, which fetch the data and display it into a Grid. 

Technologies that were used in the BE: 

* NODE
* Express
* MySQL

Technologies that were used in the FE: 
* React
* TypeScript
* MUI
* Redux Toolkit
* React Router Dom @v6
* Storybook

In order to run this application, you need to follow the next instructions: 

Running Scripts on the BE: 
* Be sure that you are on the backend folder (cd backend) and run npm install first in order to install all the dependencies. 
* After that you can execute npm run dev. It will run your application in PORT 3500. You can use POSTMAN or even Thunderbird rest applications
* http://localhost:3500/api/accounts
* http://localhost:3500/api/business

Running Scripts on the BE: 
* Be sure that you are on the frontend folder (cd frontend) and run npm install first in order to install all the dependencies. 
* After that you can execute npm run start. It will run your application in PORT 3000

## What is left?

* The application can grows. So, it would be nice to work with Jest and React Testing Library in order to write some unit test. 
* Also it would be nice to define an ATOMIC DESIGN folder structure
* It would be awesome if we can work with absolutes routes, not relatives in order to avoid (.../.../). Lack of time could not work on it!
* It would be awesome to work with TS also in the BE
* Working with some ESlint, Prettier and Husky (githooks) should be a MUST in every proyect. 
* We can improve our imports using some library that can help us with our imports orders in our components

## How much hours were invested in this proyect?
I have received this assesment last friday, at the end of the day. I have invisted the follow time, both in fe and be: 

## Backend:

* BE server (2hs)
* Data Base (3hs)
* Routers and Controllers and (2hs)

## Frontend: 

* UI (2hs)
* Redux Setup and features (3hs)
* Async calls, fetching data and pass data into DataGrid (3hs)
* Storybook (1,5hs)
* Documentation (1,5hs)
