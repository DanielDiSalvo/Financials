# Financials App

**Welcome to this proyect!**

## This is a fullstack application. 

We have a BE service which sends two differents tables: Accounts and Business. 

Also we have a FE, which fetch the data and display it into a Grid. 

Technologies that were used in the BE: 

* NODE
* Express
* MySQL

Technologies that were used in the FE: 
* React
* TypeScript
* MUI
* Redux Toolkit
* React Router Dom @v6
* Storybook

In order to run this application, you need to follow the next instructions: 

Running Scripts on the BE: 
* Be sure that you are on the backend folder (cd backend) and run npm install first in order to install all the dependencies. 
* After that you can execute npm run dev. It will run your application in PORT 3500. You can use POSTMAN or even Thunderbird rest applications
* http://localhost:3500/api/accounts
* http://localhost:3500/api/business

Running Scripts on the BE: 
* Be sure that you are on the frontend folder (cd frontend) and run npm install first in order to install all the dependencies. 
* After that you can execute npm run start. It will run your application in PORT 3000

## What left?

*The application can grows. So, it would be nice to work with Jest and React Testing Library in order to write some unit test. 
*Also it would be nice to define an ATOMIC DESIGN folder structure
*It would be awesome if we can work with absolutes routes, not relatives in order to avoid (.../.../). Lack of time could not work on it!
*It would be awesome to work with TS also in the BE
*Working with some ESlint, Prettier and Husky (githooks) should be a MUST in every proyect. 
*We can improve our imports using some library that can help us with our imports orders in our components
